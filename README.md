This repository presents the files used to build a solution for diabetes detection.

## Background

Diabetes is a serious chronic disease in which individuals lose the ability to effectively regulate blood glucose levels, and can lead to reduced quality of life and life expectancy. After different foods are broken down into sugars during digestion, the sugars are released into the bloodstream. This signals the pancreas to release insulin. Insulin helps allow the body's cells to use these sugars in the bloodstream for energy. Diabetes is usually characterized by the body not producing enough insulin, or being unable to use the insulin that is produced as effectively as needed.
Complications such as heart disease, vision loss, lower limb amputation, and kidney disease are associated with chronically high levels of sugar remaining in the bloodstream for people with diabetes. While there is no cure for diabetes, strategies such as losing weight, eating healthy, being active, and receiving medical treatment can mitigate the damage of this disease in many patients. Early diagnosis can lead to lifestyle changes and more effective treatment, making predictive models of diabetes risk important tools for public and public health officials.
Although there are different types of diabetes, type II diabetes is the most common form, and its prevalence varies according to age, education, income, location, race, and other social determinants of health. Much of the burden of the disease falls on those of lower socioeconomic status as well. Diabetes also represents a huge burden on the economy.


## The scope of the project will consist of:
1. Preparation of Project Plan.
2.	Creation of Data Pipeline to automate the steps of the data project (See need to create a Diagram).
3.	Creation of a Predictive Model that given a certain set of characteristics, the model can detect whether the person has any of the diseases or not and its probability. 
4.	Creation of a Dashboard for decision making. 
5.	Creation of a Data App for consumption of the model. 
6.	Elaboration of a presentation of the results.
